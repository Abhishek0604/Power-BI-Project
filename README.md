# Power-BI-Project
This project analyzes banking customer data to uncover insights into demographics, transaction behavior, customer segmentation (RFM), and risk indicators. Interactive Power BI dashboards with KPIs, charts, and filters help identify loyal vs. high-risk customers, track revenue patterns, and support data-driven decision-making in the banking sector.
